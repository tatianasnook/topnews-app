## Description
Top Daily News App is a React Native project that provides users with the ability to quickly check daily news on their smartphones or iPhones. The app fetches daily news from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

1. When you first open the app, you are directed to the Home page, which displays the top 20 daily news articles.
2. Users can open each individual article by tapping on them. I have utilized the TouchableOpacity component to ensure it is clear to the user which article they have selected.
3. In the article page, users can view the title, picture, and a short description of the news. If they wish to read the full article, there is a "Read Full Story" button that redirects the user to the original posting through a link to the original article.
